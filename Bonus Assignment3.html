    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Final Destination is an American horror franchise that includes six films, ten novels, and two comic books. It is based on an unproduced spec script by Jeffrey Reddick, originally written for the television series The X-Files. All of its films' plots are based on the premise of a small group of people who escape impending death after one visionary individual has a sudden premonition and warns them about a major disaster that is about to occur. After avoiding their foretold deaths seen in the visions, the survivors are later killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force, described as Death itself, that creates complicated chains of cause and effect, resembling Rube Goldberg machines. The visionary then reads omens in an attempt to again avert the deaths of the survivors.</p>
